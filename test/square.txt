# This program solves the quadratic equation for real numbers #

#
  The main function receives a, b and c coeffs of the quadratic formula
  and solves the equation. Possible variants:
    1) Quadratic equation with two real solutions
    2) Quadratic equation with one real solution  (D == 0)
    3) Quadratic equation with no  real solutions (D < 0)
    4) Linear    equation with no  real solutions
    5) Linear    equation with one real solution
    6) Linear    equation with infinite number of solutions
